Okay, I understand. Since I cannot access external URLs or databases, I will provide a **general overview of e-invoicing specifications, format guides, and compliance requirements, focusing on common aspects and best practices, rather than specific Hungarian regulations.** This will be a broad overview, and you'll need to consult official Hungarian sources for accurate and up-to-date information.

Here's a breakdown of what a typical e-invoicing specification entails:

**I. Core Components of an E-Invoice Specification:**

* **Data Model:** This defines the structure of the e-invoice, specifying the mandatory and optional data fields. It's the blueprint for how the information is organized.
 * **Invoice Header:** Contains general information about the invoice, such as:
 * Invoice Number
 * Invoice Date
 * Currency
 * Invoice Type (e.g., standard, credit note, debit note)
 * Supplier Information (Name, Address, Tax ID)
 * Customer Information (Name, Address, Tax ID)
 * **Invoice Lines:** Details each item or service being invoiced.
 * Item Description
 * Quantity
 * Unit Price
 * Discount (if applicable)
 * Tax Rate
 * Line Total
 * **Invoice Totals:** Summarizes the financial aspects of the invoice.
 * Subtotal (before tax)
 * Tax Amount (broken down by tax rate)
 * Total Amount Due
 * Payment Terms (e.g., due date, payment methods)
 * **Additional Information:** May include fields for:
 * Purchase Order Number
 * Contract Number
 * Delivery Address
 * Notes or Comments

* **Data Format:** Specifies the technical format used to represent the data. Common formats include:
 * **XML (Extensible Markup Language):** A widely used format for structured data exchange. Often preferred for its flexibility and machine-readability.
 * **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** Another popular format, especially for web-based applications. More lightweight than XML.
 * **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange):** An older, but still used, standard for business-to-business communication.
 * **PDF/A:** A PDF standard designed for long-term archiving. Often used in conjunction with embedded XML data (PDF/A-3).

* **Transport Protocol:** Defines how the e-invoice is transmitted between systems.
 * **AS2 (Applicability Statement 2):** A secure and reliable protocol for exchanging data over the internet.
 * **SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol):** A secure method for transferring files.
 * **Web Services (SOAP or REST):** Allows for real-time exchange of e-invoice data.
 * **Email:** Sometimes permitted, but often less secure and less automated.

**II. Format Guides:**

* **Detailed Field Definitions:** A comprehensive explanation of each data field, including:
 * **Data Type:** (e.g., string, integer, date, decimal)
 * **Length Restrictions:** (e.g., maximum number of characters)
 * **Allowed Values:** (e.g., a specific code list for currencies or tax rates)
 * **Mandatory/Optional Status:** Whether the field is required or not.
* **Example Invoices:** Sample XML or JSON files that demonstrate the correct structure and data formatting.
* **Validation Rules:** Rules that define how to check the e-invoice for errors and inconsistencies.
* **Code Lists:** Standardized lists of codes used for various data elements (e.g., country codes, currency codes, tax codes).

**III. Compliance Requirements (General):**

* **Legal Requirements:** E-invoices must comply with the legal requirements of the country or region where they are issued and received. This often includes:
 * **VAT Compliance:** Correct calculation and reporting of VAT.
 * **Archiving Requirements:** Specific rules for how long e-invoices must be stored and how they must be protected.
 * **Authenticity and Integrity:** Ensuring that the e-invoice is authentic (issued by the correct supplier) and that its content has not been altered. This is often achieved through digital signatures or electronic seals.
* **Technical Requirements:** E-invoices must meet certain technical standards to be accepted by the recipient's system. This may include:
 * **Format Compliance:** Adhering to the specified data format (e.g., XML, JSON).
 * **Data Validation:** Passing validation checks to ensure data accuracy and completeness.
 * **Interoperability:** Being compatible with different e-invoicing systems.
* **Reporting Requirements:** In some countries, businesses are required to report e-invoice data to the tax authorities in real-time or periodically.

**IV. Key Considerations for E-Invoicing Implementation:**

* **Choosing the Right Format:** Select a format that is widely supported and meets the legal requirements of the relevant jurisdictions.
* **Ensuring Data Quality:** Implement processes to ensure that the data in your e-invoices is accurate and complete.
* **Security:** Protect e-invoices from unauthorized access and modification.
* **Integration:** Integrate your e-invoicing system with your accounting and ERP systems.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test your e-invoicing implementation before going live.
* **Staying Up-to-Date:** E-invoicing regulations and standards can change, so it's important to stay informed of the latest developments.

**Specific to Hungary (Disclaimer: This is based on general knowledge and may not be completely accurate or up-to-date. Consult official Hungarian sources for definitive information):**

* **NAV (National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary):** The NAV plays a central role in e-invoicing in Hungary.
* **Online Invoice Reporting:** Hungary has a real-time invoice reporting system where businesses are required to report invoice data to the NAV.
* **XML Format:** The NAV typically specifies a particular XML format for invoice reporting.
* **Digital Signature/Electronic Seal:** Likely required to ensure the authenticity and integrity of e-invoices.

**To get accurate information about Hungarian e-invoicing, you should consult the following resources:**

* **The website of the National Tax and Customs Administration of Hungary (NAV).**
* **Official government publications and regulations related to e-invoicing.**
* **E-invoicing service providers that operate in Hungary.**
* **Tax advisors and legal professionals who specialize in Hungarian tax law.**

Remember to always verify information with official sources, as regulations can change. Good luck!
