Okay, I understand. Let's assume we *do* have information about e-invoicing updates in Hungary. I'll create a script based on a hypothetical scenario.

Welcome to your latest regulatory update. Today, we’re focusing on Hungary and some important changes to their e-invoicing regulations that you need to be aware of.

First up, the Hungarian Tax Authority, or NAV, has announced a tightening of real-time reporting requirements for e-invoices. Previously, certain transactions fell below the reporting threshold. Now, *all* B2B invoices, regardless of value, must be reported to NAV in real-time. This means businesses need to ensure their invoicing systems are fully integrated with NAV's online platform to avoid potential penalties. It's crucial to review your current setup and confirm compliance as soon as possible.

Next, let’s look at a change concerning the accepted e-invoice formats. While the existing XML format remains valid, NAV is now strongly encouraging the adoption of a new, updated XML schema. This new schema is designed to streamline data processing and improve accuracy. While not yet mandatory, using the new schema will likely become a requirement in the near future, so it's wise to start planning the transition now. Check the NAV website for detailed specifications and implementation guides.

Another important update involves the archiving of e-invoices. The retention period for e-invoices in Hungary has been clarified and standardized. All e-invoices must now be securely archived for a minimum of eight years. This applies to both the sender and the recipient. Make sure your archiving procedures meet these requirements to avoid potential compliance issues during audits.

Finally, there's been a clarification regarding the use of qualified electronic signatures. While not mandatory for all e-invoices, using a qualified electronic signature is now strongly recommended, especially for invoices with higher values or those involving cross-border transactions. This adds an extra layer of security and authenticity, reducing the risk of fraud and disputes.

That wraps up today’s regulatory highlights for e-invoicing in Hungary. Thanks for listening, and stay tuned for more updates.
