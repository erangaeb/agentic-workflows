Okay, I understand. Since I cannot access external URLs, I will need you to provide the content of the e-invoice specification directly. Once you provide the text, I will generate the structured markdown summary as requested, focusing on:

*   **Format Requirements:** Mandatory fields, data types, file format.
*   **Validation Rules:** Checks, error handling, consistency.
*   **Tax and VAT Compliance:** VAT obligations, reporting, country-specific rules.
*   **Submission and Reporting:** Filing deadlines, submission process.
*   **Regulatory Updates:** Changes from previous versions, new compliance measures.

Please paste the e-invoice specification content here.
